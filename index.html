        <p>The quality of mentorship – The coaches and trainers are the main highlights of any training academy since they are responsible for nurturing your child’s talents. Make sure to look into the tennis academy’s coaching faculty and methodically compare their credentials with other coaches in other institutions. 
            The networks and opportunities – Which tournament would your child be competing in? Who are the guest mentors that they would be learning from? What networking opportunities would your child get? Try to find answers to all these questions while considering an academy.<br>
            The infrastructure available – Proper equipment and good courts are super important for the right kind of tennis training. Other than that, a modern gym and hostel facilities are a bonus, since they will help your child remain fit and focused. So, do verify the quality of infrastructure being offered.</p>
